# VibComp
Vibration compensation algorithm development for 3d printers
Low computation cost, should be implementable on 8-bit controllers.

vibcomp.pdf (WIP): article describing the algorithm

gcode-postprocess (WIP): gcode postprocessor

simulation: small C++ program, plots uncorrected and corrected paths in a postscript file; parameters can be changed in source code.
